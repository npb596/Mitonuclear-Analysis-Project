# This script will take two bed files containing recombination rates, GC content, and gene length values on top of standard bed information.
# The gene lengths can be found by simply subtracting bed start from end values. Finding recom rate and GC content will require additional scripts and data.
# This script is fairly repetetive, the mechanism of matching recom rate to recom rate and GC content to GC content is pretty similar. Thus, there are
# three seperate but very similar python scripts involved (named match_math[1-3].py). More specific detail can be found in each of these scripts
# but in essence they define a range of values for a matching gene to fit within. Recom rates, GC content, and gene lengths are orders of magnitude apart
# so different stringencies are required, hence marginally different python scripts.
# Additionally, this script will generate ordered "contender" and "unique" files, where the former define increasingly similar matching genes and the latter 
# simply remove duplicates from the former. A good way to be sure the script is functioning correctly is to NOT remove the files (as the script does by default)
# and then line count each contender file. Since they become increasingly stringent the lines should decrease (line count of: fourth_unique.txt < third_unique.txt etc.)
